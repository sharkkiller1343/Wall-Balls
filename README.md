Making a physic game assignment

So for this assigment there was alot of cut back from the google slide protype that I was expecting with encountering this 
code. Most Of the desgin choice that I made with having mulpliar appear when reaching to a certain points had to be scrap because of the depulicate sprite wan't possible if I was to make a new sprite which could took come time with making a new one every time. So basically in the end the game that I create for the assigment is a simple ball physic that bound off the paddle that is control by the player moving left and right. This project is inspire from a a direction build of the icon game known as pong which use similar format of the coding file, however it is code with different appoarch and different line with using one of the paddle as the player control and point score continusely on the wall.
